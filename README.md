> Roberto Verdecchia, Ivano Malavolta, and Patricia Lago. 2019. Guidelines for Architecting Android Apps: A mixed-method Empirical Study. In *Proceedings of ICSAâ€™19: IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture 2019, 10 pages. DOI: [10.1109/ICSA.2019.00023](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSA.2019.00023)*

This repository si the source code of the [Android Architecture Guidelines website](https://androidarchitectureguidelines.github.io), which contains 42 empirically-derived guidelines used for creating well architected Android applications. <br />
The guidelines cover: SOLID principles, design patterns, dependency injection tools like Dagger, and many more. <br />
The guidelines are organized around 4 themes including the most adopted architectural patterns and principles when developing Android apps.<br />

These themes include: [MVVM](https://androidarchitectureguidelines.github.io/#MVVM), [MVP](https://androidarchitectureguidelines.github.io/#MPV), [Clean](https://androidarchitectureguidelines.github.io/#Clean), [Generic](https://androidarchitectureguidelines.github.io/#Generic).
